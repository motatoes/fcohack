# Folder description

The folders are organised as follows:


```
/fco-frontend: A Vue.js application that relies on the database from the django backend 
/fcoapi: A Django app that exposes an api to be consumed by the frontend data
/preprocessing: all the preprocessing notebooks and sciprts. Note that some of the paths in the notebooks may need to be modified in order for it to work. The scripts contain notebooks to clean the data from the xml as well as scripts to avoid duplicates in the json files downloaded from wikidata.
/wikidata: contains all the scripts related to aggregating the data from wikidata


```

If you have any questions about this project feel free to message me or email me.

Also note that the aggregated wikidata is now live on https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_British_Politicians/ambassadors
